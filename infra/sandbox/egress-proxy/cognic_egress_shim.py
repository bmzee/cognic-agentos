"""Canonical egress-proxy PID1 shim — tinyproxy Filter renderer + host validator.

This module is IMAGE CONTENT: it runs INSIDE the cognic egress-proxy Docker
container as part of the entrypoint, not inside the AgentOS Python package. It
therefore uses ONLY the Python standard library and MUST NOT import from
``cognic_agentos`` (the package is not present in the proxy image).

tinyproxy runs with ``FilterDefaultDeny Yes`` (whitelist mode). The Filter file
is a list of regexes, one per line, each an anchored exact-match for an allowed
hostname. An EMPTY filter file therefore means DENY ALL egress — which is the
fail-closed posture this renderer falls back to on any malformed input.

Security note: ``re.escape`` alone is NOT sufficient to keep the
one-pattern-per-line invariant. ``re.escape("a\\nb")`` preserves the literal
newline, which would split one host into two filter lines and could widen
access. The real control is :func:`_is_valid_host`, which rejects any host
containing control characters or whitespace (among other RFC-1123 violations);
``re.escape`` is defense-in-depth on regex metacharacters only.

# just before a trailing newline, so ``$`` would let a host ending in ``\n``
# validate and inject a literal newline into the one-pattern-per-line Filter
# file. ``\Z`` closes that hole — do NOT "simplify" back to ``$``.

    - ``Port <port>`` — the proxy listen port (default 3128, the backend's

    - ``FilterDefaultDeny Yes`` — whitelist mode: only hosts in the Filter file
      are allowed; an empty Filter ⇒ deny-all.

    encrypts the URL); the proxy relies on default domain-mode filtering, which
