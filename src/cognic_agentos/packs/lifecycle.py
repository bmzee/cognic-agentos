"""Sprint 7B.1 T2 — bank pack lifecycle state machine (per ADR-012).

This module is **CRITICAL CONTROLS** per AGENTS.md "Authoring — Bank pack
lifecycle (Sprint 7B.1)". 95% line / 90% branch coverage required by the
gate at ``tools/check_critical_coverage.py`` (T7 promotion). It is the
source-of-truth for :data:`PackKind`, :data:`PackState`, the
``_VALID_TRANSITIONS`` legal-pair table, and the
:func:`validate_transition` decision function.

Consumers
---------

- :class:`cognic_agentos.packs.storage.PackRecordStore` (T3) wires
  :func:`validate_transition` into the precondition closure of
  :meth:`cognic_agentos.core.decision_history.DecisionHistoryStore.append_with_precondition`
  per Sprint-2.5 T2 atomic-primitive doctrine. The closure does
  ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on the pack row, calls this validator under
  the chain-head lock, and either raises ``LifecycleTransitionRefused``
  (transaction rolls back) or proceeds with the chain INSERT + state
  cache UPDATE atomically.
- :mod:`cognic_agentos.cli.test_harness` (T6a) extends
  ``_HARNESS_SUPPORTED_KINDS`` to the canonical 4-tuple defined here.
- The Alembic migration ``20260510_0003_packs_lifecycle.py`` (T4)
  encodes :data:`PackKind` and :data:`PackState` as CHECK constraints at
  the database layer.

Doctrine
--------

**Pure-functional contract** (Doctrine Lock C in the plan-of-record).
:func:`validate_transition` is I/O-free and dialect-free. It consumes only
its arguments and returns a closed-enum :data:`LifecycleRefusalReason`
naming the failure mode, or ``None`` if the transition is valid. The
storage layer wires it into the database precondition; this module never
touches a database.

**No RBAC / evidence checks** (Doctrine Lock G). Actor identity + evidence
presence land in Sprint 7B.2 (RBAC scopes per ADR-012 §"RBAC scopes") +
Sprint 7B.3 (5-gate approval composition per ADR-012 §"Approval gate
composition"). The 7B.1 signature is state/transition/kind-only;
``actor_role_mismatch`` and ``evidence_required`` are deliberately NOT in
:data:`LifecycleRefusalReason`.

Refusal precedence (more-specific reasons fire BEFORE generic fallthrough):

1. ``lifecycle_transition_kind_unknown`` — ``kind`` not in the canonical
   4-tuple.
2. ``lifecycle_transition_state_unknown`` — ``from_state`` or ``to_state``
   not in the canonical 11-tuple.
3. ``lifecycle_transition_name_unknown`` — ``transition`` not in the
   canonical 11-tuple. Steps 1-3 form the input-vocabulary block; if any
   fires, no semantic check runs.
4. ``lifecycle_transition_terminal_state`` — ``from_state == "uninstalled"``
   has no outgoing edges per ADR-012.
5. Per-transition specific reasons (``double_install``,
   ``revoke_already_revoked``, ``uninstall_not_revoked_or_disabled``,
   ``withdraw_post_review``, ``approve_without_review_claim``,
   ``disable_not_installed``, ``allow_list_not_approved``) — provide
   specific operator diagnostics for the most-common mistake patterns.
6. ``lifecycle_transition_invalid_state_pair`` — generic fallthrough when
   the ``(from, to)`` pair is not in ``_VALID_TRANSITIONS[transition]``
   and no specific reason matched.

``lifecycle_transition_kind_state_combination_forbidden`` is reserved for
future kind-specific transition rules and has NO emit path in 7B.1.
Future sprints adding such a rule MUST add an emit path AND a
corresponding regression test in the same commit.

ISO 42001 control mapping (Sprint 7B.1 T5)
------------------------------------------

Per ADR-006 §"Evidence emission" and the plan-of-record T5 §"ISO 42001
control mapping + fail-closed semantics tests", every pack-lifecycle
chain row is tagged with the ISO 42001 controls the transition exercises.
The canonical mapping lives at :data:`_TRANSITION_TO_ISO_CONTROLS` and
is exposed publicly via :func:`iso_controls_for` — single source of
truth for Sprint 7B.2 portal handlers + future direct callers.

The closed control vocabulary :data:`_KNOWN_ISO_CONTROL_CODES` pins the
set of codes the lifecycle map may reference at build time:

- ``A.5.31`` — regulatory governance gate (every author-side and
  reviewer-side decision lands here).
- ``A.5.32`` — operational access control (allow-list / install /
  disable / revoke / uninstall — tenant-facing state transitions).
- ``A.6.2.4`` — AI system requirements and specifications (approval /
  revocation events — gates that authorise or de-authorise a pack
  against its declared capabilities).

Widening the vocabulary is a deliberate sprint scope decision — adding
a code outside this set requires updating both
:data:`_KNOWN_ISO_CONTROL_CODES` AND the ADR-006 Phase 3.1
``compliance/iso42001/controls.py`` registry (lands in a future sprint)
in the same commit. The build-time drift detector at
``tests/unit/packs/test_lifecycle_audit.py`` refuses any silent map edit
that introduces an unvetted code.

#:
#: Per-transition rationale (each code is in
#: :data:`_KNOWN_ISO_CONTROL_CODES`):
#:
#: - ``submit`` → ``("A.5.31", "A.6.2.4")`` — author kicks off the
#:   regulatory review (A.5.31) AND declares the system requirements
#:   that will be reviewed (A.6.2.4).
#: - ``claim`` → ``("A.5.31",)`` — reviewer takes ownership; pure
#:   regulatory logging.
#: - ``approve`` → ``("A.5.31", "A.6.2.4")`` — governance gate fires
#:   on the requirements & specifications.
#: - ``reject`` → ``("A.5.31",)`` — governance gate documents the
#:   refusal.
#: - ``withdraw`` → ``("A.5.31",)`` — author cancels the regulatory
#:   review.
#: - ``allow_list`` → ``("A.5.31", "A.5.32")`` — regulatory gate
#:   plus per-tenant access-control authorisation.
#: - ``install`` → ``("A.5.31", "A.5.32")`` — operational
#:   activation under a tenant; regulatory record + access control.
#: - ``disable`` → ``("A.5.32",)`` — operational access control only.
#: - ``revoke`` → ``("A.5.32", "A.6.2.4")`` — security-incident path;
#:   access control + the AI system specification gate (revocation
#:   means specs no longer hold).
#: - ``uninstall`` → ``("A.5.32",)`` — operational access control;
#:   terminal state.
#: - ``cancel_draft`` → ``("A.5.31",)`` — author scratches an
#:   unsubmitted draft. Sprint 7B.2 T4 (per Round 6 P2 #3 decision):
#:   mirrors ``withdraw``'s ``A.5.31`` mapping since both transitions
#:   are author-cancellation flows reaching ``withdrawn`` — the
#:   regulatory-gate semantic is the same even though the source
#:   state and downstream audit narrative differ (developer scratches
#:   own draft vs. author retracts submission under reviewer attention).
#:
#: ``Mapping`` keys must equal ``get_args(TransitionName)`` exactly;
#: pinned by ``test_lifecycle_audit.py::TestSprint7B1IsoControlsMapShape``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_state, to_state

    transition
        The named lifecycle transition. Must be a member of the canonical

        ``lifecycle_transition_name_unknown``. The transition name carries
        the action semantics (``submit`` vs. ``approve`` vs. ``reject``)
        that ``(from, to)`` alone does not capture — e.g. for ``withdraw``
        the same pair could be reached by ``reject`` if reject targeted
        ``withdrawn``; for ``cancel_draft`` vs. ``withdraw`` both reach
        ``withdrawn`` but from distinct source states (``draft`` vs.
