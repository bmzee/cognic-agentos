"""Sprint 7B.2 T2 — closed-enum RBAC scope vocabulary for the bank-pack lifecycle.

Per ADR-012 §39 + BUILD_PLAN §622-625 + ADR-012 §107-110 the lifecycle
portal API ships with **13** scopes, partitioned across five groups:

- Author surface (BUILD_PLAN §622): ``pack.submit``, ``pack.withdraw``
- Reviewer surface (BUILD_PLAN §623): ``pack.review.claim``,
  ``pack.review.approve``, ``pack.review.reject``
- Operator surface (BUILD_PLAN §624): ``pack.allow_list``, ``pack.install``,
  ``pack.disable``, ``pack.revoke``, ``pack.uninstall``
- Examiner / inspection surface (BUILD_PLAN §625 + ADR-012 §75):
  ``pack.audit.read``, ``pack.invocation.read``
- Override surface (ADR-012 §107-110): ``pack.override.approval_gate`` —
  the privileged force-approve gate, added at Sprint 7B.3 T8 alongside
  the 5-gate composer's override path. Its own group
  (:data:`OVERRIDE_SCOPES`), not held implicitly by any of the four
  role groups.

:data:`PackRBACScope` is the **wire-protocol contract** — every 403
``scope_not_held`` denial body carries the missing scope as a closed-enum
string. Any addition, rename, or removal is a wire-protocol break and
shows up in :file:`tests/unit/portal/rbac/test_scopes.py`'s diff (the
parametrised literal-pin tests + the 5-group partition invariant); the
override-scope-specific assertions live in
:file:`tests/unit/portal/rbac/test_scopes_override_extension.py`.

The Sprint-7B.1 closeout L119 says "14 scopes" but enumerated 12 — a
known cite-from-memory typo in the closeout per Sprint 7B.2 plan
self-review Round 0.5. BUILD_PLAN §622-625 + ADR-012 §107-110 are the
source of truth at 13.
